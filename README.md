# Statistics for Data Science
Data science statistics project example using two sample independent T-test

## Overview
For this example project, the experiment was carried out by comparing the original newsletter which was named product A and product B which contained some changes in the language and layout of the newsletter. Both newsletters have the same color, and topic. The goal is to check which newsletter brings higher traffic to the website, namely the conversion rate. This experiment was conducted for 30 days to monitor conversion rates in each newsletter.

I was able to get experimental result using two sample independet T-test. For hypothesis, I took
* H0 = Conversion Rate B <= Conversion Rate A
* H1 = Conversion Rate B > Conversion Rate A
After using two sample T-test, P-Value is 0.000363796012828762. It means that is sufficient to reject H0.
